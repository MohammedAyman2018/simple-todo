# Simple Todo

Welcome This is the code for the first version of the todo. it's HTML, CSS and pure JS.

## **I made a [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com) explaning it in details.**

## what you gonna learn from this project

- Using localstorage.

- Manipulating DOM in practice.

<!-- - Some of important BOM methods and objects (ex: URLSearchParams, window.loaction, history) -->

- Bootstrap 5 in action.

- Create components with pure JS.

- Use JS to render dynamic content (from loclstorage).

## Future plans

1. Make it a Progressive Web Application **PWA** and make it work 100% offline (pure JS).

2. Turn it into Single Page Application **SPA** (pure JS).

3. Add backend with **NodeJs, MongoDB, Express** instead of localhost.

4. Implement it using **Vue**.

5. Implement it using **React**.

### I'm so exited about this and hope to help someone out there to know a new information
